# Installation

JOSH is installed very simply through `yarn` or `npm`: 

```text
npm i josh@latest
* OR *
yarn add josh@latest
```

JOSH itself does not require any other dependencies. However, each [Provider]() can have its own dependencies so please check their documentation. Without a provider, JOSH cannot function, so definitely you need to use one!
